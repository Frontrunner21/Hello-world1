# Hello-world1
First repository
En,these days i decide to learn somehow about coding,i know it takes time and challenging, i have never done such kind things before.
I set my Computer Science targets as one hours coding per week, and read more books about CS,i believe that coding is functional and sometimes it is mesterious.
